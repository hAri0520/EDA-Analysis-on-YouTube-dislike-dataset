# EDA-analysis-on-youtube-dislike-dataset

### Business objective:
    In a fairly recent move by YouTube, it announced the decision to hide the number of dislikes from users around November 2021. However, the official YouTube Data API allowed you to get information about dislikes until December 13, 2021. Does this move have any effect on the number of views on a video?

Approach: The dataset given is not so clean to do any analysis So the first step taken is to improve the readability of the data using various data wrangling techniques available from various methods and functions from the python pandas and NumPy library which includes handling the null values, dropping the fields which is insignificant for analysis and converting the data into desired formats. The next step is to do the appropriate analysis to find out the impact of the dislike count on the number of views a video can attain.

Tools used: Python (NumPy, Pandas)
